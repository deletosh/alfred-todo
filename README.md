alfred-todo
===========

An Alfred v2 Workflow for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/).

Expects the "todo.sh" script in "/usr/local/bin".  If you have it installed in a
different directory, or if you want to configure a couple of other parameters,
type "t conf" into Alfred and pick the "Configure the workflow" option.

You can download the workflow [here](https://github.com/venkytv/alfred-todo/raw/master/Alfred-TODO.alfredworkflow).
